* People
	* Always **deliver value**, above everything else
	* Be **direct** and **collaborative** in your response
	* Be honest, take responsibility and don't pass the buck
	* Probelm solve - the process is :
		* Define the problem
		* Identify the root cause
			* Find and solve the **root cause of the issue** (without using any money)
		* Brainstorm solutions
		* Choose the best one
		* Implement it
		* Verify that it worked
	* Always go direct to the person, team or where the issue is
	* Use the right expertise
		* Team for their way of working, estimates 
		* Customer for the requirements or product feedback
		* Problem solve before you escalate
			* Collaborate with the sponsor, but try and solve it first
			* Do not suspend the project, if you can help it
			* Do not add resources or delay items, if you can help it
	* [Conflict](https://appflowy.com/app//d396694f-dc79-4bf5-9128-8310c462024d)
		* Understand conflict resolution types
			* Go for problem solve first, compromising next
			* Only accomodate if there is extreme power imbalance (eg. Project sponsor)
			* Senior executives can influence other senior executives
			* Problem solving [Win/Win], Compromising [Lose/Lose], Accomodating [Lose/Win], Forcing [Win/Lose], Withdraw or Avoiding conflict - Not ideal
				* Only problem solving and compromising should be the answers
			* Understanding **accountabilities** and **responsibilities**
	* Leadership
* Process
	* Agile
		* Make work visbile
		* Use Kanban board
			* View work building up
			* Limit work in each column
		* Demo real things
		* Work directly with customers on product requirements
		* Co-located, face-to-face comms are ideal
		* Protect the team from impediments and diversions
		* MVP is a small piece to test the market
	* Predictive
		* Project charter has high level goals and deliverables
		* Team charter has ways of working, roles and agreements
		* General Earved value management (PV, EV,AC)
		* SPI and CPI (more than 1 = more value delivered)
		* SV and CV (positive = more value delivered)
		* Stakeholder Management Plan
			* Use this for finding people, adding people and who and how to enagage
			* **Identify** stakeholders and **classify** stakeholders so you know who to engage
			* Use your communications management plan for how and what to communicate with those stakeholders
		* Scope Management
			* Requirements come from the customer (or benchmarking or best practices)
			* We turn these in to **Scope Statement**, **WBS** or **Work Packages**
			* Customer can verify scope through Quality Control
			* Project Sponsor signs off the scope once complete
		* Schedule Management
			* Fast tracking - Perform activities in parallel
			* Crashing - Adding resources and cost - increases risk
		* Estimate with the team
			* 3 point / triangular estimate = (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic estimate)/3
			* Beta / Pert = (O + 4XML + P)/6
			* Bottom up estimation
				* Adding up lower level items 
			* Analogous estimates
				* Using similar project to estimate
			* Parametric estimation
				* Using a parameter
		* Change Management Process
			* Anyone can request a change → Put in change log → Analyse cost and schedule → Take it to approvers (Change control board CCB) → Communicate outcome (approved/rejected/deferred) → Note outcome in change log
			* Found or created in Change Management Plan
		* Risk Managment
			* Issue has happened → Note in Issue Log
			* Risk could happen in future → Note in Risk Register
			* Identify or brainstorm risks with your team → Log in Risk register → Classify by likelihood and impact (1-5) → Respond to higher risks early → If risk was previously identified, use Risk Reponse first
			* Risk Response
				* Accept - Noting the risk but not doing anything
				* Mitigate - Take an action to address it 
				* Transfer - Using insurance or transferring to other party
				* Escalate - We dont have the authority to address it
				* Avoid - Removing the scope that causes risk
		* Procurement Management
			* Statement of work - what needs to be done by the vendor
			* Always check contract if there is a dispute
			* We can help problem solve but vendor is responsible for their deliverable and not us
			* Do not delay the project
			* Fixed Price - Scope is clear and stable
			* Cost Reimbursable - If scope is expected to change
			* Time and Material - Cost of seller's time and materials, ongoing
		* Closing
			* Finalise any open claims → Confirm formal acceptance → Esnure transition to ops → Formally release resources → Finalise and close any accounts → Final lessons learned → Archive project information → Measure project benefits
	* Agile and Predictive together - HYBRID
* General Exam Tips
	* Highlight all key words in the question - what is the main idea in the question
	* Determine if project is agile, predictive or hybrid
	* Decide which topic or principle from PMBOK is being addressed
	* Strikethrough any answers that are not related to question
	* Select one of remaining answer
	* Answer every question
	* Flag the questions that you are unsure of

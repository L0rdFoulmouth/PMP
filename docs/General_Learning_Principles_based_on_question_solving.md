* Don't usually discuss team related issues at the sprint review
* All assumptions must be treated as risks and should be analysed, weighed and organised
	* Deadlines which have clear dates etc. are project requirements or contraints and not risks
	* Similarly other requirements are not risks
* Sprint retrospective is a **Debriefing exercise** and not a **Review** or **Audit** or **Quality Assurance**
* In a weak matrix, Project Manager has less power
	* Everything should go through the Product owner and not the PMO - like opportunities
* What is a Code of accounts?

	* Configuration management system ensures that the requested changes to the project scope, the project features and the product scope are thoroughly considered and documented
* If you have just started the project and you need to give an estimate, you can only do a **Rough estimate**
* Even if the project terminates pre-maturely, the scope must be validated against the delivered work
* **Information Radiators** provide historical information on how the project is doing
* Anticipated quality standards are not part of the project charter. Following are:
	* Summary milestones
	* Summary budget
	* Project Manager and the authority level
* What is **gulf of evaluation?**
	* Team members have different interpretations of the customer's description of the product

* **Expectancy theory**
	* Individuals will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behaviour over others due to what they expect from the chosen behaviour
* Risk register is not the part of the Risk Management plan
* **Sapir-Whorf hypothesis**
	* States that understanding of the culture, local language and colloquialisms enables poeple to have a better understanding of the country they're working in
* What is rolling wave planning?
	* Used when things become clearer as you progress in the project
	* If there are some uncertainities in the regulatory work etc. use this kind of planning
* What is backward pass analysis?
* What is dependency structuring?
* What is lead and lag optimisation?
* Compliance or Law Changes should always be the high priority items that a Project Manager should address
* What are sprint burn up charts?
* What are sprint burn down charts?
* Fishbowl window
	* Persistent video link between dispersed and distributed team members
	* Provides an opportunity for remote team members to participate informally in discussions throughout the day
* Gold plating 
	* Doing extra work which is not in the scope
* What are primary risks, secondary risks, residual risks etc.?
* Agile unified Process
* Kanban
	* Emplys a pull system - meaning when a task is complete, it triggers someone to pull the next item in the queue
	* Kanban teams work off a Kanban board that displays each task
	* Kanban board sets a limit ot how much work in progress [WIP] can be in place
* Crystal Framework
	* Core values include People, Interaction and Community
	* Understanding the impact things have on wya of work and getting things done
	* Clear, Yellow and Medium is the way to prioritise - based on dollars spent on the project
* Red-Green Refactor
	* Process of writing a test that initially fails, adding code until the test passes, then refactoring the code 
	* Part of Test Driven Development (TDD)

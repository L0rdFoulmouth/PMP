* Combination of traditional methods with agile
* Can be implemented in a number of different ways
* project work can go from **Definable** vs **High uncertainity**
	* Definable
		* Clear procedures
		* Proved successful on similar projects
		* Car production or electrical appliances
	* Uncertainity
		* not done before
		* high rates of change, complexity and risk
		* Software development, designing a house

Four lifecycles of a project
* Predictive
* Iterative
* Incremetal
* Agile

|Approach|Requirements|Activities|Delivery|Goal|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Predictive|Fixed|Performed once for entire project|Single Delivery|Manage cost|
|Iterative|Dynamic|Repeated until correct|Single|Correctness of solution|
|Incremental|Dynamic|Performed once for a given increment|Frequent smaller deliveries|Speed|
|Agile|Dynamic|Repeated until correct|Frequent smaller deliveries|Customer value|
## Hybrid Method 1
* Design → Develop → Test in Agile
* Rollout → Predictive
* Agile development followed by a Predictive rollout

## Hybrid Method 2
* Combination of Agile and Predictive used simultaneously

## Hybrid Method 3
* Predominantly predictive approach with only a small part in Agile

## Hybrid Method 4
* Predominantly agile approach with only a small part in predictive
* Some projects where a small part is outsourced - external company is predictive

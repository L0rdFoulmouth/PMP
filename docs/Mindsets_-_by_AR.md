28. **The product owner creates and maintains the backlog**
	1. Train if needed, but don't do it yourself
1. **Use co-location to enhance collaboration**
	1. Face-toface comms with whiteboards is the most effective
	1. Provide wall space for sticky notes etc.
	1. Use radiators like burndown charts
	1. Use Kanban to limit work in progress
	1. Agile emphasizes iterations, visual workflows and ongoing stakeholder input
1. **Roll out methodology changes gradually using pilot or phased implementation**
1. **Agile requires ongoing customer feedback and continuous validation**
### Quality and Delivery
32. **Define quality requirements early and check them often**
	1. For agile, definition of done should be well defined
1. **Customers should validate deliverables for scope and quality**
	1. For agile, Customers check the quality and scope at the sprint review meeting with the MVP
1. **Use inclusive tools like whiteboards rather than complex software when possible**
	1. Low-tech/High-touch
1. **Use bottom-up estimating for more accurate results**
	1. For agile, use relative estimating techniques like story points and planning poker, focussing on team velocity and capacity rather than detailed task-level estimates
### Risk and Procurement
36. **Identify and document risks early and thoroughly**
	1. Don't start the work until you know the risks
	1. Risks are also continuously evolving and getting documented
1. **Document responses for both threats and opportunities**
	1. Risks are stored in Risk Register
	1. Risk Management plan tells you how to manage risks but doesn't list down risks
1. **Use mutually beneficial contracts in procurements**
### **Project Lifecycle and CLosure**
39. **Update the lesson learned register throughout the project**
1. **All projects should be formally closed, whether completed successfully or terminated early, ensuring all bills are paid and resources released**
### **Continuous Improvement**
41. **Repeat and reinforce the project vision to the team**
1. **Clarify what success and failure look like on the project**
1. **In agile, use Retrospectives to review and improve methods**
1. **Implement feedback loops - apply lessons from one task to the next**
### Cost and Schedule Management
45. **Avoid cost and time overruns**
	1. If you must choose, fix budget issues before schedule
	1. Agile manages contraints through adjusting scope
1. **Focus on critical path when assessing schedule impacts**
	1. Agile manages schedule through sprint commitment and velocity tracking. Highest priority items are completed first
### Exam strategy & decision guidelines
47. **Watch for answer choices with absolute terms like "Always" or "All", they're often incorrect**
1. **Never do nothing**
1. **The perfect answer isn't always listed. Choose from choices available**
1. **Sometimes there is no correct answer. It is not about selecting the correct one - it is about selecting the best one**

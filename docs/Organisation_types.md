### Organic
* Small organisations or companies
* Project Management is not necessarily a full-time function - someone from project team can take responsibility for managing the project
* Some key PM responsibilities like Budget decisions etc. are out of PM's control

### Functional 
* Team works in separate silos - each silo reporting to a Functional Manager
* All the project work typically happens within a particular department - with department's manager (Functional manager) completely in charge of everything
* PM has very less authority and works more of an expeditor to get things done on time
* PM does mostly admin tasks
* Functional manager has complete authority in this org type
	* Proejct team members report to a FM
	* Project management decisions are approved by the FM
	* PMs are assisstant to FMs in terms of getting the work done
	* No one person responsible for an entire project

### Multi-division 
* Quite similar to functional org as far as PM role is concerned except that they do a bit of coordination as well like hosting meetings, communicating project status etc.
* Each division may have a completely different way of managing projects
* Each division may be seen as a different company when it comes to project management

### Matrix
* Many orgs fall in to this category
* Functional and Project Managers share authority
* **Weak Matrix**
	* Functional Manager has higher authority
	* Functional Managers are responsible for resource related decisions as well as approving all major project decisions
	* Project Manager is still a coordinator or expeditor in this org
* **Balanced Matrix**
	* Project team members report to two bosses - PM and FM
	* Project Managers get people related decisions approved by the functional managers while functional managers also getting project decisions approved by the PM
* **Strong Matrix**
	* Proejct Manager has a higher authority
	* Team still reports to two bosses - but since the delivery of the project is more important, PM has a say in people decisions as well as performance assessment

### Project-oriented 
* Teams are organised around projects 
* After project completion, teams are released to be allocated to new projects
* PM has the most power in this org - responsible for budgets, schedule, quality, resources and other areas

### Composite
* Blends the functional, matrix and projectised org structure
* There can be a particular PM model selected on a project to project basis

### Virtual
* People from different geographies, time zones and even different companies (like external vendors) are part of the team
* PMs often facilitate team communications and can have authority over buudgets, resource allocations and other areas

### Hybrid
* Aim of hybrid organisation can be two-fold - 
	* Bringing in the best practices from different orgs structures in to one
	* Ensuring orgs can have adaptive life cycles as well as predictive life cycles based on the requirements
* Role of PM varies depending on what kind of hybrid model is being adopted

### Project Management Office
* PMO has full authority over every project within an org
* The way PMO functions is highly depended on how it is set up

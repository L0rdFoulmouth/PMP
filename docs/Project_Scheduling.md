## Crashing
* This is addition of project resources or working longer hours or changes to the original project baseline to speed up the overall timing of the project completion 
* This is typically the last resort option as it can often lead to i**ncreased costs and reduced quality**
* It requires measuring the cost of crashing against the beenfits of early completion

**When to use crashing?**
* Delays
	* Project started late
	* Significant delays or disruptions compromising the likelihood of completion on time
* Budget Exhaustion

**How to use crashing?**
* Ex. Project takes 6 months but stakeholder asks to complete it in 4 to benefit from a cost saving program
* Planning 
	* Identify tasks that need to be finished and prioritised
* Effective communication and collaboration

## Fast-tracking
* Timeline of the project is shortened by overlapping or eliminating certain tasks or activities
* It may mean working on activities simultaneously instead of linearly
* Often considered a risky tehcnique as it can lead to **coordination problem** and **potantial quality issues**

**When to use fast tracking?**
* When it is possible to start simultaneously different aspects of a project

**How to use fast tracking?**
* Identify all essential tasks that need to be completed to ensure project success
* Determine which activities can be performed in parallel

> Usually Fast tracking is done before crashing since it does not cost more.

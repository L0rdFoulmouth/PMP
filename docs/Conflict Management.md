* **Conflict Management Techniques**:
	* **Compromise/Reconcile**: Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties (lose-lose).
	* **Force or Direct**: Pushing one’s viewpoint at the expense of others (win-lose).
	* **Collaborate or Problem Solve**: Methodical steps to deal with a problem for a permanent solution.
	* **Smooth or Accommodate**: Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than differences to maintain harmony.
	* **Withdrawal**: Postponing a decision
**1. Compromise/Reconcile**
* **Description**: This technique involves finding a middle ground where each party gives up something to reach a mutually acceptable solution. It's often seen as a lose-lose situation because neither party gets everything they want.
* **When to Use**: Use compromise when both parties have equal power and influence, and a quick resolution is needed. It’s suitable when the conflict involves moderate importance issues.
* **Levels of Influence and Power**: This technique is effective when both parties have similar levels of influence and power, making it easier to negotiate and reach a consensus.
**2. Force/Direct**
* **Description**: This technique involves pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others, leading to a win-lose situation. It is assertive and uncooperative, relying on authority to resolve the conflict.
* **When to Use**: Use this technique in emergencies or when quick, decisive action is necessary. It is appropriate when the stakes are high, and a decision must be enforced.
* **Levels of Influence and Power**: This technique is effective when the person using it has high power and influence over others, such as a project manager or senior leader imposing a decision.
**3. Collaborate/Problem Solve**
* **Description**: This technique involves working together to find a win-win solution that satisfies all parties. It is both assertive and cooperative, focusing on understanding and addressing the underlying concerns.
* **When to Use**: Use collaboration when the issue is too important for a compromise, and a long-term solution is needed. It is suitable for complex problems where different perspectives can lead to a better outcome.
* **Levels of Influence and Power**: This technique works best when all parties involved have similar levels of power and influence, or when there is a high level of trust and openness in the team.
**4. Smooth/Accommodate**
* **Description**: This technique involves emphasizing areas of agreement rather than differences to maintain harmony and relationships. It often results in a lose-win situation, where one party gives in to the others.
* **When to Use**: Use smoothing when the issue is more important to the other party or when maintaining relationships is more critical than resolving the conflict. It’s suitable for minor issues or when the other party has a stronger position.
* **Levels of Influence and Power**: This technique is effective when the person smoothing the conflict has less power and influence, or when preserving relationships is crucial for future collaboration.
**5. Withdraw/Avoid**
* **Description**: This technique involves postponing or avoiding the conflict, hoping it will resolve itself or become irrelevant over time. It is both unassertive and uncooperative.
* **When to Use**: Use withdrawal when the issue is trivial, when there’s no chance of winning, or when more time is needed to prepare for a resolution. It’s also appropriate if the conflict is part of a larger pattern that needs to be addressed later.
* **Levels of Influence and Power**: This technique can be used by anyone, regardless of their level of power and influence, but it’s often employed when the person has low power or when the conflict is not worth the effort to engage.

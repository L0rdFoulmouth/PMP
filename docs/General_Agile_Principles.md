* Trust before collaboration
* Promotes self-directed and self-managed teams
* The team and not the product owner or manager should determine the stories
* Product owner/manager controls the backlog
* New ideas should be put in the backlog
* **Risk Management in Agile**
	* Risk analysis conducted at the start of each iteration
	* Higher risk prioritised and completed first
	* Risk should ideally be addressed/mitiagted at the start of the project
* **Iteration and Review**
	* Sprint Review vs Retrospective
		* Review is about deliverables and outcomes
		* Retrospective focuses on the processes
* **Team Dynamics**
	* When team makes a suggestion - first assess its validity
	* Support the team in developing an ddefining project vision
	* Support the team to perform tasks, even technical tasks like quantitative analysis, through coaching, mentoring, and training (Servant Leadership)
* **Usual best practices**
	* **Process**
		* Follow agreed-upon processes
		* Show/Deliver value
		* Communication plans alone do not ensure project success; work to identify and align performance indicators with the deliverable
	* **People**
		*   Attend cultural sensitivity training to understand and respect cultural differences
		*   Go beyond just developing an awareness of local customs
		*   Something around emotional intelligence or take care of team member emotion
		*   Assess team member skill and provide training, coach, mentor, collaborate, servant leadership (Agile concept)
		*   Self-organization > Central management
		*   Analyze the situation and develop/present a solution  OR  inform stakeholders (depends on the magnitude of the issue)
		*   DON’T discuss team’s concerns with the functional manager
		*   If a key stakeholder WILL leave the project, that’s an issue
		* Meet with new stakeholders to review documents, even if they say things are critical
	* **Always Do (ALWAYS)**
		* Face the challenge head-on and have private conversations
		* In Agile, encourage the team to find new ways of working to achieve higher levels of performance

* **Answering agile related questions**
* The right answer in Agile is sometimes to:
	*   Support the team in coming up with their own answer
	*   Allow the team to decide and evolve their roles and responsibilities
	*   Support the team in developing and defining the project vision
	*   Support the team to perform tasks through coaching, mentoring, and training (Servant Leadership)
* What to Avoid (NEVER)
	*   Fire or replace people
	*   Request additional money or resources, suggest progressive financial rewards
	*   Ask the project sponsor to deal with it (be careful of answers with sponsor in it)
	*   Anything with HR
	*   Anything with negative wording
	*   Anything with ‘never’ or ‘always’ (unless you’re 100% sure)
	*   Anything passive like ‘monitor’ if you need to avoid a risk or address an issue
	*   Escalate without review/evaluate/assess
	* Make potentially unnecessary changes if everything is on track
* Competitive environments are bad but individual rewards can be good
* When a new project manager takes over an ongoing project, one of the first steps is to review the project's history and current status with the project sponsor

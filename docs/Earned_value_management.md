* EVM is used in planning, management and control of projects and programs
* It is a **project management budgeting** technique measuring cost and schedule against a baseline
* The result is a simple set of metrics that provide early warnings of **performance issues** and allows for timely and appropriate adjustments to be made 

### Earned Value Equations
* **Total budget cost for the project OR Budget at completion (BAC)**
	* Original budget of the project
	> 
	> **BAC = Given**


* **Planned Value (PV)**
	* This is the budgeted cost of work that is scheduled to be done at a given point in time
	* This is the amount of money worth of work that should have been done till now
	> 
	> **PV = Budgeted Cost of work X Planned completion**


* **Earned Value (EV)**
	* Budgeted cost of work which is actually performed at any given point of time 
	* Amount of money worth of work that has actually been done on the project
	> 
	> **EV = Budgeted cost of work X Actual % Complete**


* **Actual Cost (AC)**
	* This is the actual cost that is incurred for all of the work that is performed at any given point of time
	* money spent on the project so far
	> 
	> **AC = Given **


* **Cost variance (CV)**
	* Difference between actual work done and money spent
	* Difference between earned value and actual cost
	* **Negative value means we are over budget**
	> 
	> **CV = EV - AC**


* **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**
	* Rate of how we are spending to actually earning on the project
	* Measure of cost efficiency
	* **Value under 1 means we are over budget**
	> 
	> **CPI = EV / AC**


* **Schedule Variance (SV)**
	* Difference between the amount of work done against the amount of work that should have been done
	* Difference between earned value and the planned value
	* **Negative value means we are behind schedule**
	> 
	> **SV = EV - PV**


* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
	* Rate of how we are meeting project schedule
	* Measure of schedule efficiency
	* **Value under 1 means we are behind schedule**
	> 
	> **SPI = EV /  PV**


* **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
	* Forecasting the total value cost of the project at the end based on the current rate of spending
	> 
	> **EAC = BAC / CPI**


* **Estimate to complete (ETC)**
	* Forecasting the amount that will be needed to complete the current project based on the current performance
	> 
	> **ETC = ****EAC - AC**


* **Variance at completion (VAC)**
	* Difference between original budget and new forcasted budget
	* **If positive, it means under budget**
	> 
	> **VAC = BAC - E****AC**


* **To-complete Performance Index (TCPI)**
	* Performance that needs to be met to complete the project within the budget
	* **Number above 1 means team needs to work harder than currently to finish the project**
	> 
	> **TCPI = (BAC -EV) /  (BAC - AC)**



**Scenario 1**
BAC = $100
Duration 5 days
PV = $60
EV = 75% X 100 = $75
AC = $70

Cost Variance (CV) = 75 - 70 = 5 (Under Budget) CPI = 1.07
Schedule Variance (SV) = 75% - 60% = 15% (Ahead of schedule) SPI = 1.25
EAC = 100 /  1.07 = 93.45
ETC = 93.45 - 70 = 23.45

VAC = 6.55
TCPI = 25/30 = 0.83

**Scenario 2**
BAC = $4000
Duration = 4 years = 48 months
Completed = 17 months
PV = 17/48 X 4000 = 1417
EV = 0.35 X 4000 = 1400
AC = 1500
CV = -100 **Over budget**
CPI = 1400/15000 = 0.93 **Over budget**
SV = 1400 - 1417 = -17 **behind schedule**
SPI = 1400/1417 = 0.98 = **behind schedule**
EAC = 4000/0.93 = 4301
ETC = 2801
VAC = -301
TCPI = 1.04
